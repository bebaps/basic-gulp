## What does it do?
This is a basic setup for getting started using Gulp. The included plugins out of the box are really just here to give you a good idea of the many different ways that you can setup your workflow. Feel free to customize it as needed for your project.

In a nutshell, this setup:

- Uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as the primary task runner.
- Uses [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) as the web server.
- Uses [PostHTML](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml) for optional processing of HTML files.
- Uses [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for processing CSS files.
- Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for processing JS files.
- Uses [Imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) for processing image files.
- Uses [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS linting.
- Uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JS linting.
